# Human Posture Detection- An ECS Project
## This repository contains the master code which includes a slouch detection, a yoga pose detection (trained on 6 layers of CNN with 2142 images) and a gym form detection (trained on the same 6 layers of CNN with 3360 images), which was made for an Engineering Clinics Project by my team and me, Diptorshi Tripathi at VIT-AP University.

### The images were all procured by our team and are not for public use.
